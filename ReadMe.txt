Hi!, This is Enun, The Creator of airberlin suave. 

There are a few things i feel you must note: 

1. Check in before using Gate, Track Your Luggage or In-flight Snack.
2. In the backend , the Booking Id is the fulcrum of my application. 
-->  It is used to make POST(In-Flight Snack, Solve  A Problem and Stressalyssa) requests.
-->  It is used to make GET(Gate, Track Your Luggage) requests.

3. Due to the instability of the availabilities section, i decided against marring my application with
constant booking errors.
Therefore,  you must make a booking id(resource_class:booking), set gate time(resource_class:gate_g) with that
booking id set luggage(luggage:checked in, past counter, in flight etc.) with the hints i set.

You May Use These Expired B_id's:
